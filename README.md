### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Joystick and I like to make stuff:

I'm currently working on: 
``` json
{
  "Projects" {

    "Red40": {
        "https://github.com/Joystick299/Red40"
    },

    "MickeyDees": {
        "https://github.com/Joystick299/MickeyDees"
    },
    
    "Amethyst": {
        "https://github.com/Joystick299/Amethyst"
    },
    
    "SummerHeat": {
        "https://github.com/SamWRX/SummerHeat"
    }
  }
}
```

I'm currently learning C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, and a little bit of Python!

I try to make my projects open sourced because I want everyone to be able to collaborate on them.
Feel free to post your changes and I will take a look!
